# ASP Downloads

import AswmDownload from '@site/src/components/aswm-download';

AdvancedSlimePaper builds are split into several branches, including main, develop, and various feature or PR branches.

The `main` branch is stable and well-tested, but it may not always include the latest Paper commits. For bleeding-edge updates, see `paper_upstream`, which includes untested automatic changes.

The `develop` branch is experimental — it’s generally up-to-date with the latest features and versions, but may include a few bugs.

All other branches should be considered highly unstable. These may include breaking API changes, incomplete features, or **unsafe third-party code** from pull requests.
