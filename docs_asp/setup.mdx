# Setup
This page covers how to quickly get ASP up and running on your server.

## Install Java
Since Minecraft version 1.20.6, Java 21 is required to run the server.

### Windows
We suggest installing [Adoptium JDK 21](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin21-binaries/releases/download/jdk-21.0.3%2B9/OpenJDK21U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_21.0.3_9.msi)

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
apt update && apt install temurin-21-jdk
```

## Download Advanced Slime Paper / Pufferfish / Purpur

ASP is actively developed for Paper; Pufferfish and Purpur versions are based on it, but updated less frequently.

### ASPaper
We recommend using the Paper version for the most stable experience.
AdvancedSlimePaper builds are split into several branches, including main, develop, and various feature or PR branches.

The `main` branch is stable and well-tested, but it may not always include the latest Paper commits. For bleeding-edge updates, see `paper_upstream`, which includes untested automatic changes.

The `develop` branch is experimental — it’s generally up-to-date with the latest features and versions, but may include a few bugs.

All other branches should be considered highly unstable. These may include breaking API changes, incomplete features, or **unsafe third-party code** from pull requests.

## Run ASP
Simply use the JAR file you downloaded as a server JAR.

## Next steps
At this moment, ASP is only a server providing the ASP API, nothing else.
If you don't want to use the API, or want a utility plugin, we **recommend installing the [SlimeWorldPlugin](swp/installation)**
