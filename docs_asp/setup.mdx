# Setup
This page covers how to quickly get ASP up and running on your server.

## Install Java
Since Minecraft version 1.20.6, Java 21 is required to run the server.

### Windows
We suggest installing [Adoptium JDK 21](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin21-binaries/releases/download/jdk-21.0.3%2B9/OpenJDK21U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_21.0.3_9.msi)

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
apt update && apt install temurin-21-jdk
```

## Download Advanced Slime Paper / Pufferfish / Purpur

ASP is actively developed for Paper; Pufferfish and Purpur versions are based on it, but updated less frequently.

### ASPaper
We recommend using the Paper version for the most stable experience.

#### Main
Tested and ready for production.
```
Download links will be added later
```

#### Develop
Contains the latest features and bug fixes, but is **BARELY** tested and might not work at all.
```
Download links will be added later
```

#### Upstream
Contains the latest patches from Paper, but is **NOT** tested.
```
Download links will be added later
```

### ASPufferfish
The Pufferfish version is updated less frequently than Paper.
```
Download links will be added later
```

### ASPurpur
The Purpur version is updated less frequently than Paper.
```
Download links will be added later
```

## Run ASP
Simply use the JAR file you downloaded as a server JAR.

## Next steps
At this moment, ASP is only a server providing the ASP API, nothing else.
If you don't want to use the API, or want a utility plugin, we **recommend installing the [SlimeWorldPlugin]("")**
